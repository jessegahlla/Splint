The Flint Multi-Structure Suite
===============================

Welcome to Flint, protein folder. Flint is the beginning of a spiffy protein folding suite based on the All-atom Multiple Structure-Based Model developed by Jesse Singh, Paul Whitford, N.R. Hayre, Daniel Cox, and Jos√© Onuchic. This suite will eventually include everything one needs to:

		* Set-up an molecular dynamics environment, organized by temperature. (Splint)
		* Create a multiple structure topology file. (Hint)
		* Create an MD analysis environment and begin analyzing results using
		John Chodera's Multistate Bennett Acceptance Ratio (MBAR) module (Flint)
		
This implementation will be done piecemeal, in the same order as just written.

Dependencies
------------

You need Python installed to create the environment, Gromacs to start runs, and MBAR to analyze the potential of mean-force.
